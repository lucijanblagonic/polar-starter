# Polar Starter

Simple project starter that generates a style guide using KSS methodology. Setup with Gulp. Place to learn, experiment and improve project delivery for clients.

## Getting Started

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

    npm install gulp
    npm install

Build with `gulp build`

This will create a `build` for project assets and templates and a `styleguide` directory from your SCSS documentation.

Use `gulp watch` for on–the–fly updates of your code (templates, js, css) and style guide.
